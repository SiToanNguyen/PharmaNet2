# PharmaNet2

PharmaNet2 is a personal project that I work on independently. The goal is to provide tools for pharmacies, helping them operate more efficiently and save time. This is a remake of my bachelorâ€™s project. In this version, I've switched from Flask and SQLite (used in the original version) to Django and PostgreSQL to improve performance and scalability. The web application is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Features

- Manage products, manufacturers, and categories.
- Manage purchase and sale transactions, and track finances.
- Manage inventory, track products coming in and out, and monitor expiry dates.
- Generate financial and inventory reports.
- Keep activity logs of system use, including user actions and timestamps.

## Accessing the Demo Website on AWS

To try out the live demo hosted on AWS:

   [http://pharmanet-proxy-page.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/](http://pharmanet-proxy-page.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/)

2. Wait for the server to boot up. This may take up to 2 minutes.

3. When the server is ready, its URL will be displayed on the page.
