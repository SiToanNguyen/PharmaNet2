# PharmaNet2

PharmaNet2 is a personal project that I work on independently. The goal is to provide tools to pharmacies, helping them operate more efficiently and save time. In this version, I've switched from Flask and SQLite (used in my old project) to Django and PostgreSQL to improve performance and scalability.

## Features

- Manage products, manufacturers, and categories.
- Manage purchase and sale transactions, and track finances.
- Manage inventory, track products coming in and out, and monitor expiry dates.
- Generate financial and inventory reports.
- Keep activity logs of system use, including user actions and timestamps.
